# web-projects

Repo containing my web projects (Mostly JS)

The folders with the prefix fcc are the projects done on freecodecamp.org
I went through a few of these tasks to get started with JavaScript and frontend development.


## fcc-request-header-parser-ms
A microservice that exactly what it says. It parses request headers, and checks details about browser, OS etc.

## fcc-timestamp-ms
A microservice that was hosted on Heroku. Took user input for a timestamp and validated it.
